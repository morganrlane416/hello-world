This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow for Code:You.

About me: My name is Morgan Lane and I am a high school math teacher. I am in my ninth year teaching and most days, I really enjoy it! I have a tiny bit of background in coding from a variety of undergrad and graduate courses I took. I'm looking forward to learning more!
